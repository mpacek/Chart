# Chart Project with Babel, and Gulp

Starter code for transpiling ES2015 (including modules) with Babel, Gulp and Browserify.

# Installing

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install -g gulp` to install Gulp globally.
3. `npm install` to resolve project dependencies.
3. `bower install` to install frontend dependencies.

# Using

Run `npm start` from the command line and you are good to go! Now you can open <http://localhost:8000>

The project is currently setup to transpile code under the _/src_ folder using the _/src/app.js_ file as an entry point.

All LESS/CSS files are placed in `public/assets/` folder

Resulting code ends up in the `public` directory.
